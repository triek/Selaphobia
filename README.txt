SELAPHOBIA
-----------------
This is an platformer game made entirely by Triek.
You can play by open this project in an IDE (preferably IntelliJ) and execute the MainClass class. The only control button is Left-click, click to jump.

All the graphics are homemade using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. The code is in Java using IntelliJ IDE. Most of the code I learned from KaarinGaming PlatformerTutorial, but Java is still a pain. Yes, it is Geometry Dash rip off.

This game has many potential to be improved. I will add music so it can become a rythm game. Definitely some  flashing light effects so the game can live up with its name (Selaphobia is the fear of flashing lights). Some more orbs like gravity-changing, teleporting and more powerful boost orbs. Improve the graphics, add more background and blocks. The hardest thing is the map maker, I don't even have any idea how to make it, but it's not impossible though. Lastly, I would like some more brains to work on this together, it would be fun.

Thank you for playing, have fun!

Triek.
